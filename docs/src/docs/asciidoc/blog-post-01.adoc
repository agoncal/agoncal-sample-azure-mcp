== Introduction

* Link to the previous blog post
* Link to the code of this blog post
* Brief recap of MCP and its purpose
* The problem: complexity of Azure infrastructure deployment (you can use Azure CLI, Powershell, Bicep, Terraform, or the Azure portal to deploy Azure resources)
* How natural language interfaces can simplify Azure management
* What we'll build: a Quarkus-based MCP server for Azure

== Designing the MCP Azure Server

* You can either have one single MCP server for all your Azure services or have one MCP server per Azure service (one for Storage Accounts, one for PostgreSQL, etc.)
* Overview of MCP server capabilities for Azure
* Quarkus MCP server extension for the rescue
* Tool definitions for common Azure operations
* Authentication and security considerations
* Error handling and response formatting

== Creating Resource Groups with MCP

* Managing resource groups
* Implementing tools
* Building a Fat-JAR with Quarkus

== Creating Storage Accounts with MCP

* Managing storage accounts
* Implementing tools
* Building a Fat-JAR with Quarkus

== Integrating with IDEs

* User experience and natural language interaction patterns
* Claude Desktop
* VS Code integration
* Configuration files

== Conclusion

* Benefits of natural language Azure management
* MCP server for Azure
* MCP is endless
